DevOps and it’s applications

The goal of DevOps is to change and improve the relationship by advocating  better communication and collaboration between the two business units

DevOps practices and procedures lead to smoothing out the typically  ‘bumpiest’ aspects of software development and deployment.

By pulling infrastructure setup and awareness earlier in the development  cycle, surprises from environmental differences are significantly reduced.

By establishing consistent, reliable and repeatable automated deployments,  human error and the need for ‘rockstar firefighters’ are reduced.

In many ways, DevOps is about ensuring quality at all stages.
